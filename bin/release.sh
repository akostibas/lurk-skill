# release.sh — cut a tagged release of lurk.
#
# Releasing is a multi-step workflow (tests green -> tag -> push -> GitHub
# release). This script makes it mechanical and refuses to proceed when a
# precondition isn't met, so a release can't go out from a dirty tree, the
# wrong branch, or with failing tests.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/release.sh <version>     # explicit, e.g. v0.2.0
#   bin/release.sh patch         # bump x.y.Z from the latest tag
#   bin/release.sh minor         # bump x.Y.0
#   bin/release.sh major         # bump X.0.0
#
# By default a release runs the smoke test (bin/smoke-test.sh) after the unit
# tests, so a release can't ship a build that no longer reads Slack or Signal.
# It costs nothing but needs a Mac signed into both apps, and prompts once for
# Keychain access. Pass --no-smoke to skip it (e.g. a docs-only bump).
#
# See ../CLAUDE.md for what counts as a patch/minor/major change.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = released, 1 = precondition failure, 2 = tests/smoke failed.
