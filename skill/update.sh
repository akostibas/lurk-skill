#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# update.sh — upgrade this skill (binary + skill files) to the latest GitHub
# release. Portable self-update pattern: to reuse in another skill, copy this
# file and change the REPO / SKILL_NAME / BIN vars below. The repo must ship a
# Makefile whose `install` target accepts a SKILL_DIR override (see this
# project's Makefile).
#
# What it does:
#   1. Resolves its own directory as the skill install location — so it upgrades
#      wherever it was installed (~/.claude or a project-level .claude).
#   2. Reads the latest release tag from the GitHub API.
#   3. Without --yes, prints the plan and exits (so the caller can confirm).
#      With --yes (or an interactive yes), clones the tag into the system temp
#      dir, runs `make install SKILL_DIR=<here>`, then removes the checkout.
#
# No files are written outside the system temp dir; the checkout is removed on
# exit. Requires git, curl, and the Go toolchain. The build also fetches the
# pinned SQLCipher sources (see bin/vendor-sqlcipher.sh), so it needs network
# access and takes ~30s.
#
# Usage:
#   update.sh            # show the plan (current → latest), confirm if a TTY
#   update.sh --yes      # apply without prompting (the agent-driven path)
